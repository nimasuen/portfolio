            <h3>Story:</h3>
            <p>
                Melody Marshall makes music! Melody pairs up music students with tutors who train them and practice their chosen instrument. 
                Lessons can take place in one of Melody's music rooms on the premises or at other arranged locations. Melody has a staff of three assistants who are able to give lessons in basic piano, guitar, and violin, but most lessons are set up with tutors who work on a freelance basis. 
                Instruments are available for rent from Melody, though many students have their own instrument. Students (or their parents) pay Melody for the lessons, and she pays the tutors for lessons taught at the end of each month. 
                Melody would like a system to keep track of lessons that take place, and produce reports with information about scheduled lessons, fees owed and paid for lessons and instrument rental, and payments to tutors.

            <h3>What Does the Project Involve?</h3>
            <p>
                My team of 3-4 students will work together to create a complete database system for an imaginary small business or organization. 
                In the six modules of the course you will complete the following steps:
            </p>
            <li>
                <ol>Gather and refine specifications for the system.</ol>
                <ol>Create a conceptual design for your system by creating an Entity-relationship Diagram (ERD)</ol>
                <ol>Convert your ERD into a logical model consisting of a set of table structures.</ol>
                <ol>Construct and populate these table structures in MySQL.</ol>
                <ol>Write a set of queries to extract the relevant information from your tables.</ol>
                <ol>Build a web interface for your system using PHP and HTML.</ol>
            </li>
